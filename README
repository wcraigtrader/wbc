WBC: Generate iCal calendars from the WBC Schedule spreadsheet

PURPOSE:

The World Boardgaming Championships (http://boardgamers.org/#wbc) is a huge
annual boardgame tourney, with more than 100 tournaments running over the 
course of 9 days.  While the WBC produces their event schedule in many forms,
they don't produce iCal-style web calendars for the tournaments.  This program
is intended to fill the gap.

PREREQUISITES:

* BeautifulSoup4
* icalendar
* requests
* requests_cache
* xlrd

USAGE:

Install the prerequisites and then run WBC from the command line:

	mkdir build
	python WBC.py

This will download the available calendar references, compare them,
and generate the appropriate iCal calendars in the build directory.
